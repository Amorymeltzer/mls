### ToDo
- Sanitize files
- Build checks to ensure data and site build are valid
- Nothing after total, nothing past OPS
#### Archive system
- Generation
- Index
- Pages

#### Planning
- Get list of all xlsx
- Everything except cl-provided file gets archived
- If 1, current text
- If >1, build archive page
- List individual pages on main index.html (sorted by date?)
- Each archive gets own, sortable table
- Links on subpages to go back to index
- Small links to other archived tables
- Main index page for entire index

- index.html should display total or season or...?
- Get input from Joe, team


#### Appearance
- Check iPad sizes
- Better gradient?
