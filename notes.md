### ToDo
- Convert to python?
- Individual column sorting? https://github.com/tristen/tablesort/pull/97
#### Future design
- Front with brief splash, link to current/ongoing past stats
- 1 or 2 photos, link photos page?
- More content! :+1: :100: :+1:
#### Stats
- Per-game data, graph if played more than one game (cut down on 1-off anomalies) (20% threshold?)
- Team stats (RF/RA), record, etc.?
- More sabermetrics?  wOBA, others?
- Stat predictions, goals?  PCA plots? -> Joe
- Individual stats with goal AVG?  Would need player pages...
#### Archive system
- Small links to other archived tables - next/previous seasons?
- Should mainpage list seasons from oldest to newest, newest to oldest, or old to new within a year, or what?  Maybe new line for each year?
#### Revamp plan
- Stats for individual games, one per worksheet (google doc, name: Season Year MM/DD))
- Set axis for calculated stats to start at 0?  Should start at zero for everyone?
- PA/AB/etc. checks for division by zero, proper sums (H+K+BB+SAC<PA, etc.)
- Link to schedule on main page?
#### JS
- Fix mouseover tooltip on final newly-created points
- Section headers on season pages?  <script>document.write(location.pathname)</script>
#### HTML rewrite
- Chart text
- Update news for start of season!
- Why so small?  Font size shrunk but the table is tiny
- Maybe beef up font size?  Or just table size?
- Might be jekyll artifact, check when live
