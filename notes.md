### ToDo
- Sanitize files

- Nothing after total, nothing past OPS
#### Archive system
- Generation
- Index
- Pages

#### Planning
- Get list of all xlsx
- Also allow xls via glob regex?
- XLSX ISN'T THE WAY FORWARD IT'S CSV CSV CSV
- Everything except cl-provided file gets archived
- If 1, current text
- If >1, build archive page
- List individual pages on main index.html (sorted by date?)
- Main index page for entire index
- Each archive gets own, sortable table
- Links on subpages to go back to index a la enWiki ARBCOM <- AC/C/D/E
- Small links to other archived tables - next/previous seasons or just archive index?

- index.html should display total or season or...?
- Get input from Joe, team


#### Appearance
