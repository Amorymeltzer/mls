### ToDo
- Build checks to ensure sanitary data and valid site build
- Check if input handled properly, not in files, etc
- index.html should display total or season or...?  Get input
- Use perl to parse csv, skip xlscat entirely?
#### Archive system
- List individual pages on main page index.html (sorted by date?)
- Small links to other archived tables - next/previous seasons?
#### Multiple sheets
- Return original formatting?  Figure out attr
- Better way to deal with blank column, zero
#### Photo section
- Proper spacing, order
- Size?
- Captions?  Titletext?
- Popup in-window, with text (kind of like KSP historian or something)
- Peruse gh for good photo gallery options
- Programmatic?  Prob overkill.
- Rename archive-nav span
#### Appearance
- Check iPad sizes
