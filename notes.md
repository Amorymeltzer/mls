### ToDo
- More content! :+1: :100: :+1:
- Player noisiness is a real issue if they missed the first X games.  Currently not figuring for it but should
- See colors of maximum contrast in dropbox
#### Stats
- Team stats (RF/RA), PCA plots?
- Could show team average, at least for calculated stats
- Individual stats with predictions, goal AVG?  Would need player pages...
- Player page could show graph with total/cumulative stats, list results per season
- Or good place to show some sort of scatter graph?  I'm sure some saber site has a good example
- Or perhaps one of those radial diagrams?  With various stats?  Relates to PCA...
#### Revamp plan
- Convert to python, R?
- Change as many elements as possible from px to (r)em
- Deal with graphs at beginning of season (ugly, pointless)
- Link to schedule on main page?  Or show upcoming/next game(s)?
- Videos?  gh-pages can't embed, but maybe plyr.js can?
#### JS
- Angle X-axis to save space.  Should probably extend margin a bit to make up for it
- Or just skip some...?
- Check out D3plus? https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus/ and http://d3plus.org/examples/advanced/9862486/
- Or Chartjs? https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js
- Labels overlap, how can I deal with that?  Force-directed?
- Or use a legend?  http://d3-legend.susielu.com or http://www.competa.com/blog/2015/07/d3-js-part-7-of-9-adding-a-legend-to-explain-the-data/
