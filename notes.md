### ToDo
- More content! :+1: :100: :+1:
#### Stats
- Stat predictions, goals?  Team stats (RF/RA), PCA plots? -> Joe
- Individual stats with goal AVG?  Would need player pages...
- Sort players by batting order?  Eh.
- Player noisiness is a real issue if they missed the first X games.  Currently not figuring for it but should
#### Archive system
- Small links to other archived tables - next/previous seasons?
- Should mainpage list seasons from oldest to newest, newest to oldest, or old to new within a year, or what?  Maybe new line for each year?
#### Revamp plan
- Convert to python, R?
- Change as many elements as possible from px to (r)em
- Deal with graphs at beginning of season (ugly, pointless)
- Link to schedule on main page?  Or show upcoming/next game(s)?
#### JS
- Check out D3plus? https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus/ and http://d3plus.org/examples/advanced/9862486/
- Labels overlap, how can I deal with that?  Force-directed?
- Or use a legend?  http://d3-legend.susielu.com or http://www.competa.com/blog/2015/07/d3-js-part-7-of-9-adding-a-legend-to-explain-the-data/
