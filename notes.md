### ToDo
- Build checks to ensure sanitary data and valid site build
- Check if input handled properly, not in files, etc
- index.html should display total or season or...?  Get input
- Use perl to parse csv, skip xlscat entirely?
#### Archive system
- List individual pages on main page index.html (sorted by date?)
- Small links to other archived tables - next/previous seasons?
#### Multiple sheets
- Return original formatting?  Figure out attr
- Better way to deal with blank column, zero
#### Photo section
- Proper spacing, order
- Size?
- Captions?  Titletext?
- Popup in-window, with text (kind of like KSP historian or something)
- Peruse gh for good photo gallery options
- Programmatic?  Prob overkill.
- Rename archive-nav span
#### Appearance
- Check iPad sizes
### Future design
- More content! :+1: :100: :+1:
- Move all stats to /stats, archive to /stats/archive
- Front with brief splash, link to current/ongoing past stats
- 1 or 2 photos, link photos page
