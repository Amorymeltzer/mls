### ToDo
- index.html should display total or season or...?  Get input
- Use perl to parse csv, skip xlscat entirely?
- Parse main, joint xlsx into csv (skip intermediate xlsx, (tables?))
- Be better about picking seasons (multipleWorksheets.pl)
- Individual column sorting? https://github.com/tristen/tablesort/pull/97
### Future design
- Front with brief splash, link to current/ongoing past stats
- 1 or 2 photos, link photos page?
- Move all stats to /stats, archive to /stats/archive
- More content! :+1: :100: :+1:
- Team stats (RF/RA), record, etc.
- More sabermetrics?  wOBA, others?
- Individual stats/graphs over time? -> Joe
#### Archive system
- List individual pages on main page index.html (sorted by date?)
- Small links to other archived tables - next/previous seasons?
